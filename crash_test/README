Firmadyne-TriforceAFL crash test user agents

This directory contains the source code of the user agent programs that test kernel modules
against the bugs found by TriforceAFL during the Firmadyne experiments.

The code is almost identical to the fuzzing harness of TriforceAFL.
However, instead of receiving input from the fuzzer/QEMU through a hypercall, the
agent now receives the input from a file as bytes. This is important if we want
to test for a bug outside TriforceAFL (e.g., Firmadyne or actual IoT device).
By feeding the input of a crash case to the agent, it will parse it and
convert it to IOCTLs which will then execute.

The agent takes two inputs: 1) the character device corresponding to a kernel module, and
2) the crash input generated from TriforceAFL.


TODO: Add instructions of how to compile the agent using the different toolchains.
